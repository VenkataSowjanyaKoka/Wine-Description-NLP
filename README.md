# Wine-Description-NLP
Natural Language Processing of Wine Description and origin Classification with Logistic Regression in PySpark

# Introduction:

The curated data contains two fields – Origin and Description. Origin refers to the country of origin. It is either US or Non-US, implying wine US or Non-US made. The description refers to reviews/description written by wine critics.

Objective is to analyze the data to determine if the words used in the description can be used to predict wine’s country of origin. This is a end -to-end case. We will work with PySpark and MLlib’s functionality and implementation of ML algorithms to complete this project.

# Steps followed and questions answered,

1.	Clear Statement of the problem to solve.
2.	Statement/Comment on the data collection (in terms of what is needed) and scope. 
3.	Preliminary decision about the ML algorithm you will use. Justify your decision to use this particular algorithm
4.	Statement/comments on data preparation and clean up. What do you need to do to get data ready for the ML algorithm of your choice.
5.	Perform data prep and clean-up. 
6.	Conduct Explanatory data analysis (EDA). Comment on data distribution. 
7.	Comment on required data transformation needed to get the data ready for input to the ML algorithm of your choice. Remember, all data available in the CSV document are of string data type. 
8.	Complete all needed data transformation. Use TF-IDF method of transforming token to their respective numeric values. 
9.	Apply the ML algorithm of your choice. Use an 8-/20 split for creating training and test dataset. 
10.	Train the model using the training dataset. Comment on the overall model fit using evaluation metrics of your chosen ML algorithms. Comment on your findings and draw conclusions about the trained model’s accuracy and worthiness. 
11.	Test/Evaluate your trained model with test dataset. Again, evaluate the model’s performance using the evaluation metrics available for your ML algorithm. Again, comment on your findings and draw conclusions about the model’s accuracy and worthiness in terms solving the problem you were trying to solve.
